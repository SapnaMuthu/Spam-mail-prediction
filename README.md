Project Title: Spam Mail Prediction using Machine Learning with Python

Description:
The Spam Mail Prediction project utilizes machine learning techniques to classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam). It involves data preprocessing, model training using logistic regression, and the development of a predictive system to classify new emails.

Workflow:

Data Collection & Pre-processing: Raw email data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame and pre-processed to handle null values.
Label Encoding: Categories are encoded as binary values (0 for spam, 1 for ham).
Train Test Split: The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
Feature Extraction: Text data is transformed into numerical feature vectors using TF-IDF Vectorization.
Model Training: Logistic Regression model is trained using the training data.
Model Evaluation: Model accuracy is evaluated on both training and testing data.
Building a Predictive System: A system is developed to predict whether new emails are spam or ham based on the trained model.
